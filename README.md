`docs` directory contains RMarkdown, the report in PDF, .bib file with references and journal-of-ecology.csl.
<br>
`figs` directory contains the figures.
<br>
`R` directory contains the scripts.
<br>
`README.md` is exactly this file, wich gives a brief and general ideia of the project.

# Dataset

Data analysis was done in `RStudio`. The data used in this project is from the package `BIEN` (Botanical Information and Ecology Network). Package `maps` was used to generate the base world map, in order to plot the points of occurences of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_.
