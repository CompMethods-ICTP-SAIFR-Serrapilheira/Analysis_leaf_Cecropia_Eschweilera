## Introduction 

The genus _Cecropia_ belongs to the family Urticaceae and consists of species of pioneer trees [@BergRosselliDavidson2005]. The genus _Eschweilera_ belongs to the family Lecythidaceae.

Plant functional traits are attributes that potentially affect establishment, survival and fitness of plant individuals [@Reichetal2003]. Two examples are specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf nitrogen content.

Specific leaf area (SLA, i.e., leaf area per leaf dry mass) is an inverse index of leaf density or thickness [@ReichWalters1994]. A correlation between specific leaf area (SLA) and mass of nitrogen (N~mass) has been previously identified in 23 Amazonian tree species, one of them being _Cecropia ficifolia_. In all species analysed, across increasing leaf age and light gradients, SLA decreased and so did N~mass, but proportionally slower, in a way that N~area increased [@ReichWalters1994].

In the study of Raaimakers et al. (1995), nine tropical rainforest tree species were defined as pioneer or climax, based on regeneration strategy: _Cecropia obtusa_ was classified as a pioneer species and _Eschweilera sagotiana_ as a climax species. The results showed that, for tropical rainforest trees, pioneer species have higher leaf phosphorus and nitrogen content in comparison to climax species [@Raaimakersetal1995].

I formulated two hypothesis in the present study. The first hypothesis is that the specific leaf area of _Cecropia_ is greater than that of _Eschweilera_. The second hypothesis is that the leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ is higher than that of _Eschweilera_.  


## Methods

For the current study, I used the package BIEN [@BIEN], the Botanical Information and Ecology Network, in RStudio [@R2022]. Firstly, all occurence records available in BIEN of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_ were ploted in a map. I gathered the data of specific leaf area (SLA, i.e., leaf area per leaf dry mass) of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_ and created a boxplot to better visualize them. The same was done for leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of both genera. I performed two Welch Two Sample t-tests, one for each trait of both genera, in order to test if both have equal means.


## Results and Discussion

According to the database of BIEN, _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_ are distributed in the Neotropics, but observations of _Cecropia_ are more widely distributed than _Eschweilera_ (for instance, there are no observations of _Eschweilera_ in Argentina, Paraguay and south of Brazil in the database of BIEN) (Figure 1).

For both genera, I loaded all available measures of the specific leaf area (SLA) - i.e., leaf area per leaf dry mass. Figure 2 shows these observations in boxplots.

The Welch Two Sample t-test of the specific leaf area (SLA) of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_ resulted in: t = -5.2641, df = 78.642, p-value = 1.191e-06. The 95% confidence interval is -8.889639 to -4.011222. Since the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, it is possible to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of SLA of the two genera.

The median of SLA of _Cecropia_ is 14.40105 m^2^/kg, the mean is 15.51825 m^2^/kg and the standard deviation is 7.191866 m^2^/kg. The median of SLA of _Eschweilera_ is 22.8217 m^2^/kg, the mean is 21.96868 m^2^/kg and the standard deviation is 9.690317 m^2^/kg. Thence, the median and the mean of SLA of _Cecropia_ are smaller than those of _Eschweilera_.

Therefore, the first hypothesis, that says that the specific leaf area of _Cecropia_ is greater than that of _Eschweilera_, was refuted. 

I also loaded all available measures of leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_. These observations are shown in the boxplots of Figure 3. 

![Leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_.]("../figs/boxplot_nitrogen.pdf"){width=60%}

The Welch Two Sample t-test of leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ and _Eschweilera_ resulted in: t = 2.4205, df = 33.201, p-value = 0.02113. The 95% confidence interval is 0.6461239 to 7.4481962. The p-value is smaller than 0.05, so there is also a statistically significant difference between the means of leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of both genera.

The median of leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ is 25 mg/g, the mean is 23.72648 mg/g and the standard deviation is 7.09657 mg/g. The median of leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Eschweilera_ is 18.85 mg/g, the mean is 19.67932 mg/g and the standard deviation is 3.65172 mg/g.

The results obtained corroborate the hypothesis that the leaf nitrogen content per leaf dry mass of _Cecropia_ is higher than that of _Eschweilera_. It is possible that the particular morphology of _Cecropia_ leaves had an impact in the results of this trait.
